I present here a Dynamic Web Project using Python. An e-Shopping dynamic web project has been created that can be divided into mainly two parts, first the module for customers, who will use the application to order products and the other module has been created for sellers, who can upload the details of the product that they want to sell. The customer module enables a customer to select a product and place it in his/her wish list for easy reference later and can pick up items to his/her cart to order them. Order quantity for each product has been limited to one quantity per order. The application also helps the seller to add new products and update the price of the existing products. Both the seller and the customer can manage the orders that have been placed.
